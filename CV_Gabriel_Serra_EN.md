## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### CITEC | Remote **Senior Solutions Architect & Tech Lead** | 2021-2025

Technical leadership of an engineering team (3 developers), defining architectural strategy and the "Golden Path" for software development. Responsible for designing critical solutions integrating industrial hardware with the cloud.

* **Financial Impact (FinOps):** Achieved a **35% reduction** in cloud infrastructure costs through service re-engineering and resource optimisation in Azure.  
* **Operational Excellence (DevOps):** Implemented CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps, reducing deployment time by **90%** and eliminating production incidents through immutable artefact strategies.

*Key Projects:*

* **Industrial IoT Ecosystem (VOGT \- MIC Platform):**  
  * Designed an **End-to-End** distributed architecture for industrial machinery monitoring.  
  * Developed **Edge Computing agents in Python** (Raspberry Pi) for data acquisition via **Modbus RTU/Serial**, implementing local "debouncing" logic to optimise bandwidth.  
  * Built a real-time telemetry backend using **Node.js and WebSockets**, capable of processing high-frequency data streams and visualising them in **Next.js** dashboards.  
* **Enterprise Operations Platform (MoniPro & SRACS):**  
  * Architected a high-performance backend in **Go (Golang)** utilising **Clean Architecture** and native drivers (`pgx`) for PostgreSQL, ensuring transactional integrity and scalability.  
  * Developed native mobile applications (**Android/Kotlin** and **iOS/Swift**) with **Offline-First** architecture, implementing custom image compression algorithms and efficient memory management.  
  * Implemented advanced client-side security, including **AES-GCM** encryption and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

### FREELANCE | **Cloud Consultant & Software Engineer** | 2014-2021

Consultancy specialising in legacy system optimisation and cloud migration for the telecommunications sector.

* **Performance Optimisation:** Refactored legacy systems (PHP/MySQL), achieving a **40% improvement** in large-scale database query performance through indexing and query optimisation.  
* **Cloud Migration:** Designed and implemented cloud architecture on AWS for delivery applications, integrating backend and native mobile apps, resulting in a **15% increase** in customer retention.
